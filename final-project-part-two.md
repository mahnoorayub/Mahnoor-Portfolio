# Final Project Part 2

## Wireframes and storyboards

The storyboard link can be found here. 

I used shorthand to create my storyboard outline. The reason for this was so I could learn the tool before the final week and also see what my presentation would eventually look like. Using shorthand really helped me see how the information should flow and what more charts and research I need. I tested my visualizations in both Flourish and Tableau and after testing them with shorthand I realized it was easier to work with the charts made in Flourish. Using shorthand also allowed me to put placeholder information in areas I still need to work while making it easier for my user research audience to follow along and understand what I am eventually planning to do. 


## User Research 

### Target Audience

The target audience of my story are the people who can take an action to control the rising use of e-cigarettes. These include the federal and state authorities who can implement strategies to reduce e-cigarette use among young people, such as restricting young peoplesâ€™ access to e-cigarettes in retail settings, licensing retailers, implementing price policies, and developing educational initiatives targeting young people. My target audience also includes parents and teachers who should be aware of the rising use of these devices so they can engage the children in discussions about the dangers of e-cigarette use, seek medical  help if needed and also endorse school policies and prevention programs that address all types of tobacco products, including e-cigarettes. I aim to gain the attention of this audience by showing alarming statistics on the high number of children using these products, showing the rise over the years and discussing the negative health effects. I will share information on how while US is the largest market for these products there are no strict federal policies in place similar to the one's in EU that restrict nicotine levels in these devices to 2%. 

### Approach to identifying representative individuals to interview

I tried to find individuals from different backgrounds and age groups so I could get varying perspectives. It was hard to hard to find people who actually present my target audience but I tried to use indivuals who use vaping products and also those who dont, I included someone who has young children and then someone who is currently a student working on such policy issues.

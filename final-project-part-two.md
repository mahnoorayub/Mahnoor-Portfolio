# Final Project Part 2

## Wireframes and storyboards

The storyboard link can be found here. 

I used shorthand to create my storyboard outline. The reason for this was so I could learn the tool before the final week and also see what my presentation would eventually look like. Using shorthand really helped me see how the information should flow and what more charts and research I need. I tested my visualizations in both Flourish and Tableau and after testing them with shorthand I realized it was easier to work with the charts made in Flourish. Using shorthand also allowed me to put placeholder information in areas I still need to work while making it easier for my user research audience to follow along and understand what I am eventually planning to do. 


## User Research 

### Target Audience

The target audience of my story are the people who can take an action to control the rising use of e-cigarettes. These include the federal and state authorities who can implement strategies to reduce e-cigarette use among young people, such as restricting young peoples’ access to e-cigarettes in retail settings, licensing retailers, implementing price policies, and developing educational initiatives targeting young people. My target audience also includes parents and teachers who should be aware of the rising use of these devices so they can engage the children in discussions about the dangers of e-cigarette use, seek medical  help if needed and also endorse school policies and prevention programs that address all types of tobacco products, including e-cigarettes. I aim to gain the attention of this audience by showing alarming statistics on the high number of children using these products, showing the rise over the years and discussing the negative health effects. I will share information on how while US is the largest market for these products there are no strict federal policies in place similar to the one's in EU that restrict nicotine levels in these devices to 2%. 

### Approach to identifying representative individuals to interview

I tried to find individuals from different backgrounds and age groups so I could get varying perspectives. It was hard to hard to find people who actually present my target audience but I tried to use indivuals who use vaping products and also those who dont, I included someone who has young children and then someone who is currently a student working on such policy issues.

Q3. What do you think about the structure and flow of the story?
Q4. Is there something you find particularly interesting? Why?
Q5. Is there something you find confusing or misleading? Why?
Q6. Do you have any suggestions for improvement?

### Findings from Interviews

Questions	Interviewee 1 	Interviewee 2	Interviewee 3
Q1. At first glance, what do you understand about the storyboard? 
	It appears to be a presentation on the hazards of E-cigs particularly for the youth in US, and the need to address them.	It is a research project on vape usage among US youth.	It is discussing the increase in e-cigarettes among US students
Q2. What is this this story trying to tell? Do you think the message is clear? 
	It seems the story is trying to scale the problem, and use it to create urgency. The message seems to be clear.	The story is about understanding the the issue of e cigarettes. And the message seems obvious.	It is trying to tell how the usage of vapes is rising and how it is harmful. 
Q3. What do you think about the structure and flow of the story? 
	The structure and flow probably need to be reviewed. There seems to be an incoherence as we move from usage statistics to what a vape looks like and then back to more usage statistics. 	I felt the flow was missing in this. A lot of information compiled that can be structured in a better way. 	I feel there should be more structured sections first about introducing what vapes are, then discussing the statistics and then the health concerns and other information.
Q4. Is there something you find particularly interesting? Why? 
	I find it interesting that within 7 years vapes were able to out perform the competition with a much longer market presence/legacy.	The fact that the e-cigarette market share is so much bigger than the competitors, and that US is the biggest market is definitely insightful. 	I am surprised to learn that more people use vapes than normal cigarettes, that graph was super interesting

Q5. Is there something you find confusing or misleading? Why? 
	I didn’t fully understand the point on FDA. How is oral consumption different from inhalation?	Is the study implying that e-cigs are the new “gateway drug”? Bigger than regular cigarettes, as commonly believed? 	The map with market size does not mention what the values are referring to which is confusing. There are also too many statistics listed towards the end that are hard to remember
Q6. Do you have any suggestions for improvement?
	1.	Make information flow from one point to the next
2.	Make sure the project is self-explanatory and doesn’t require someone to present
	I would say there should citations, to make the research more credible and trustworthy. Maybe have a section that discusses how and where kids are most likely influenced into using vapes, to better assimilate the “How can you help?” section at the end.	1.	Follow a more structured approach for the sections. 
2.	Refine the labels on the graphs showing what they stand for
3.	Reduce the wording on some slides 
4.	Instead of listing the statistics make them more impactful

# Final Project Part III

The final storyboard can be accessed [here.](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/rise-of-e-cigarettes-among-us-youth/index.html) 

As mentioned in part II I created this using shorthand and made my visualizations in flourish. 

The Part III of the final project was mainly putting everything together and making the changes I highlighted in Part II. I have summarized the work done in the sections below. 


## Summary 

The presentation talks about the "Rise of E-cigarettes Among the US Youth". 

### Target Audience

The target audience of my story are the people who can take an action to control the rising use of e-cigarettes. These include the federal and state authorities who can implement strategies to reduce e-cigarette use among young people, such as restricting young peoplesâ€™ access to e-cigarettes in retail settings, licensing retailers, implementing price policies, and developing educational initiatives targeting young people. My target audience also includes parents and teachers who should be aware of the rising use of these devices so they can engage the children in discussions about the dangers of e-cigarette use, seek medical help if needed and also endorse school policies and prevention programs that address all types of tobacco products, including e-cigarettes. Lastly, my audience are the young individuals who currently vape or see others around them using vapes. I aim to gain the attention of this audience by showing alarming statistics on the high numbers of children using these products, showing the rise over the years and discussing the negative health effects. 

### Approach 

I changed my storyboard quite a bit compared to part two as I included the feedback from my interviews and general critique from class. I realized while I had several interesting statistics and visualizations my presentation was missing a strong story and narrative. This was extremely important for me to work on so I can connect with my audience and tell a story that is engaging.

Therefore I removed the first three slides that talked about the features of e-cigarettes and summzarized that into a single slide. While discussing this slide instead of listing the features I decided to tell the following scenario: 

" Imagine a 16-year-old student who notices her friends using e-cigarettes. Curious, She decides to try it herself. She likes the fruity flavor and continues to use it, thinking it is a safer alternative to traditional cigarettes. Unfortunately, She is not alone."

This helped capture the attention of the audience as I provided a relatable scenario. 

I have then added several visualizations that show how e-cigarettes have become the most commonly used tobacco product among students - greater than tradiotional cigarettes, how the use is rising and also the frequency of use among these students. We have always heard how cigarettes are bad but these statistics try to raise awareness about the growing problem of e-cigarettes which is equally concerning. 

Moving on I have added information and visualizations on the health side affects of e-cigarettes primarily talking about nicotine addiction and EVALI. I added this section to address the question on why these vapes might be as harmful as cigarettes. 

I have also added information highlighting why the young people are so attracted to e-cigarettes. This is important to understand in order to effectively address the issue. 

Lastly I have added a call to action section which provides steps parents, teachers, vape users and public officials can take. I have also linked resources that can be used for help. This section developed a lot since part II and I was able to find great resources that can be linked for an effective call to action section. These resources included programs to kids to join if they want to quit vaping, programs where parents can learn how to talk to children about the dangers of e-cigarettes and geneal resources that can help you learn more about the topic. 

I finally added a references section where I provided all citations. I also made sure that I provide the sources on the slides and also on the visualizations. The main sources for my information were Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Youth Tobacco Surveys, National Institute on Drug Abuse, University of Michigan Monitoring the Future Survey, Tax Foundation and Truth Initiative that are all linked in my final presentation. 

I also added an Appendix section which is discussed below. 

### Design and Structure Decisions

Some of these slides and visualizations were already present in part II of my project. But I spent a lot of time in refining them for part III, particulay deciding the order they should be presented in and then adding any missing compenents that might be needed for the flow of the story. 

One critical issue I faced was that I had a lot of relevant data and made quite a lot of visualizations but I had to prioritize which visualizations go best with my story and the audience I am trying to reach. Therefore I created an Appendix section where I moved all the extra visualizations that did not go with the flow of the story. These visualizations could be used by someone looking for more information and this section really helped me during my Q&A session of the presentation. 

For the design and style of the presentation I opted for dark backgrounds to give a serious look to the topic. I very carefully chose the pictures added on each slide so they complement what I am talking about for example I used a different design of vape on different slides to show how they come in varying shapes, sizes and colours. 

For the colours of the visualizations I mainly used red, brown and grey. The red colour was used to highlight the important aspects and draw the attention of the audience. I also used a variety of visualizations ranging from bar charts, line charts, map projections, inphographics and donut charts. I had to decide which chart type best presents my data and the story I am trying to tell with that data. 

I also made sure all the fonts are the same, the labels and headings on the visualizations are correct, and all visualizations are following the same colour scheme as pointed out by the crtique from part II. 


### Conclusion 

This project had a steep learning curve for me as I was able to relate my personal experience with vaping to a story I was telling. I learnt a lot about the landscape of e-cigarettes but also realized that there is still a lot more to learn as these are relatively new products which have minimal research on their long-tern side affects. 

I was able to learn how to tell a compelling story about an important topic and then also summarize the key concepts within just 60 seconds. I am really glad that I got the opportunity to learn using flourish, shorthand and tableau as I had not used these platforms before and it was great to develop this new skillset with these tools.

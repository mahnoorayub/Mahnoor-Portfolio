# Final Project Part III

The final storyboard can be accessed here. 

As mentioned in part II I created this using shorthand and made my visualizations in flourish. 


## Summary 

The presentation talks about the "Rise of E-cigarettes Among the US Youth". 

### Target Audience

The target audience of my story are the people who can take an action to control the rising use of e-cigarettes. These include the federal and state authorities who can implement strategies to reduce e-cigarette use among young people, such as restricting young peoplesâ€™ access to e-cigarettes in retail settings, licensing retailers, implementing price policies, and developing educational initiatives targeting young people. My target audience also includes parents and teachers who should be aware of the rising use of these devices so they can engage the children in discussions about the dangers of e-cigarette use, seek medical help if needed and also endorse school policies and prevention programs that address all types of tobacco products, including e-cigarettes. Lastly, my audience are the young individuals who currently vape or see other around them using vapes. I aim to gain the attention of this audience by showing alarming statistics on the high number of children using these products, showing the rise over the years and discussing the negative health effects. 

### Approach 

I changed my storyboard quite a bit compared to part two as I included the feedback from my interviews and general critique from class. I realized while I had several interesting statistics and visualizations my presentation was missing a strong story and narrative. Therefor i removed the first three slides that talked about the features of e-cigarettes and summzarized that into a single slide. While discussing this slide instead of listing the features I decided to tell the following scenario: 

" Imagine a 16-year-old student who notices her friends using e-cigarettes. Curious, She decides to try it herself. She likes the fruity flavor and continues to use it, thinking it is a safer alternative to traditional cigarettes. Unfortunately, She is not alone."

This helped capture the attention of the audience as I provided a relatable scenario. 

I have then added several visualizations that show how e-cigarettes have become the most commonly used tobacco product among students - greater than tradiotional cigarettes, how the use is rising and also the frequency of use among these students. We have always heard how cigarettes are bad but these statistics trying to raise awareness about the growing problem of e-cigarettes. 

Moving on I have added information and visualizations on the health side affects of e-cigarettes primarily talking about nicotine addiction and EVALI. I added this section to address the question on why these vapes might be as harmful as e-cigarettes. 

I have also added information highlighting why the young people are so attracted e-cigarettes. This is important to understand in order to effective address the issue. 

Lastly I have added a call to action section which provides steps parents, teachers and public officials can take. I have also linked resources that can be used for help.

# Project Part 1 

## The Rise of of Electronic Cigerrates in the US

### Background

The landscapee for tobacco products has continued to evolve to include several different types of tobacco items including including smoked, smokeless, and electronic products. Such e-cigarettes famously referred to as vapes have now become the most commonly used tobacco product amoung the U.S youth. These e-ciggerates come in a variety of different flavours, can be disposable or non-disposavle and most often contain nicotine that is a highly addictive chemical. The rapid increase in vaping during the past decade has aroused public health concern, recently heightened by potential links between vaping and acute lung injury

E-cigarettes entered the U.S. marketplace around 2007, their use among U.S. middle and high school students increased 900% during 2011-2015, before declining for the first time during 2015-2017. Data from the 2022 annual National Youth Tobacco Survey showed that 14.1% of high school students and 3.3% of middle school students said they'd recently used an e-cigarette or other vape product.

The purpose of this project is to examine the use of e-cigarretes in the US, understanding the rise over the years, the demographics of the users, the frequency of use and the most commonly used brands. 

Examining these features can help policy makers take effective actions to regulate the use of such porducts.

### Data Sources

#### 1.) FDA Annual National Youth Tobacco Survey

The National Youth Tobacco Survey (NYTS) datasets are available for public use from the year 1999 - 2021. Items measured as part of the NYTS survey include correlates of tobacco use such as demographics, minorsâ€™ access to tobacco, and exposure to secondhand smoke.

#### 2.) Center of Disease Control and Prevention 

The data can be found here. It provides relevant statistics around prevalence of current (past 30-day) e-cigarette use, overall and by selected characteristics and school level

#### 3.) Monitoring the Future Survey
Data from the monitoring the future surveys shows results from nationally representative samples of 12th-, 10th-, and 8th-grade students responses who received questions on nicotine vaping

### Method and Medium 

For the purpose of this project I would primarily be using shorthand to create my story. My story would include line graphs (to show trends over time), bar charts (for comparisions across demographics and products) and some infographics. I will build these primarily using Tableau or Flourish depending on which platform provides better visualizations for the ideas I have in mind. I will also be using Excel for some data cleaning and merging purposes so I can have all the relevant data that I need and in the correct formats.
